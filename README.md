# Price Server User Guide

Public documentation for the [Grid Coordination](https://grid-coordination.energy) price server — an [OpenADR 3.1.0](https://www.openadr.org/) VTN serving hourly California electricity prices and GHG emissions data.

## What is the price server?

The price server publishes real-time and historical electricity prices for **PG&E** and **SCE** rate schedules, plus hourly marginal GHG emissions intensity (MOER) for 11 California grid regions, as OpenADR 3 programs and events.

- **Prices**: Marginal cost in USD/kWh from the CAISO Day-Ahead Market via [GridX](https://www.gridx.com/) CalFUSE
- **GHG emissions**: Marginal Operating Emissions Rate (MOER) in g CO2/kWh from [SGIP Signal](https://sgipsignal.com/) (operated by WattTime for the CPUC)

## Available tariffs — 31 rate schedules

**PG&E — 16 tariffs** (each served across 59 distribution feeders)

| Rate | Type |
|------|------|
| `EELEC` | Standard residential electric |
| `BEV1` | Commercial EV charging |
| `BEV2P`, `BEV2S` | Business EV 2 (Primary / Secondary) |
| `B6` | Small commercial |
| `B10P`, `B10S` | Medium commercial 10 kW (Primary / Secondary) |
| `B19P`, `B19S` | Medium commercial (Primary / Secondary) |
| `B20P`, `B20S` | Large commercial (Primary / Secondary) |
| `AG-A1`, `AG-A2` | Agricultural |
| `AGBP`, `AGBS` | Agricultural Business (Primary / Secondary) |
| `AGCP`, `AGCS` | Agricultural Commercial (Primary / Secondary) |

**SCE — 15 tariffs** (each served across 46 substations)

| Rate | Type |
|------|------|
| `TOU-PRIME` | Residential time-of-use premium |
| `TOU-D-49` | Residential time-of-use 4–9 PM peak |
| `TOU-D-58` | Residential time-of-use 5–8 PM peak |
| `TOU-EV-8` | EV time-of-use 8 PM peak |
| `TOU-EV-9P`, `TOU-EV-9S`, `TOU-EV-9ST` | EV time-of-use 9 PM (Primary / Secondary / Super TOU) |
| `TOU-GS-1`, `TOU-GS-2`, `TOU-GS-3` | General Service |
| `TOU-PA-2`, `TOU-PA-3` | Public Authority |
| `TOU-8ST`, `TOU-8P`, `TOU-8S` | General Service 8 PM (Super TOU / Primary / Secondary) |

Each tariff × location combination is an OpenADR 3 program. PG&E programs are named `<RATE>-<9-digit-circuit-id>` (e.g. `EELEC-013532223`). SCE programs are named `<RATE>-<substation>` (e.g. `TOU-PRIME-Eagle Rock`).

### GHG emissions (MOER)

| Region | Program | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `SGIP_CAISO_PGE` | `MOER-PGE` | Pacific Gas & Electric (CAISO) |
| `SGIP_CAISO_SCE` | `MOER-SCE` | Southern California Edison (CAISO) |
| `SGIP_CAISO_SDGE` | `MOER-SDGE` | San Diego Gas & Electric (CAISO) |
| `SGIP_LADWP` | `MOER-LADWP` | Los Angeles DWP |
| `SGIP_BANC_SMUD` | `MOER-SMUD` | Sacramento Municipal Utility District |
| `SGIP_BANC_P2` | `MOER-BANC` | Balancing Authority of Northern California |
| `SGIP_IID` | `MOER-IID` | Imperial Irrigation District |
| `SGIP_PACW` | `MOER-PACW` | PacifiCorp West |
| `SGIP_NVENERGY` | `MOER-NVE` | NV Energy |
| `SGIP_TID` | `MOER-TID` | Turlock Irrigation District |
| `SGIP_WALC` | `MOER-WALC` | Western Area Lower Colorado |

MOER programs publish hourly marginal operating emissions rate in **g CO2/kWh**, aggregated from native 5-minute [SGIP Signal](https://sgipsignal.com/) data. Each event contains 24 hourly intervals, same as pricing events.

**Total: 31 pricing tariffs + 11 GHG emissions regions** (1,645 OpenADR 3 programs)

## Finding your program

To get prices relevant to you, you need two things:

1. **Rate schedule** — which tariff applies to your service (e.g. `EELEC` for PG&E residential, `TOU-PRIME` for SCE residential). See the tariff table above.
2. **Circuit or substation** — which part of the grid you're on. For PG&E, this is a 9-digit circuit ID identifying your distribution feeder. For SCE, it's a substation name.

The combination determines your program name: `EELEC-013532223` or `TOU-PRIME-Eagle Rock`.

**How to find your circuit or substation:** If you don't know which circuit or substation serves your location, you can browse the full list in [circuits.md](circuits.md) — it includes the substation name, division, and region for every PG&E circuit, and all 46 SCE substation names. PG&E customers on the Dynamic Rate Pilot can find their circuit ID on their billing statement or through the [Priicer community](https://forum.priicer.com/t/pg-e-dynamic-pilot-california/33).

## Data model

### Programs

One program per rate schedule × circuit/substation:

| Field | PG&E Example | SCE Example |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `programName` | `EELEC-013532223` | `TOU-PRIME-Eagle Rock` |
| `programLongName` | `PG&E EELEC — circuit 013532223` | `SCE TOU-PRIME — substation Eagle Rock` |
| `payloadDescriptors[0].payloadType` | `PRICE` | `PRICE` |
| `payloadDescriptors[0].units` | `kWh` | `kWh` |
| `payloadDescriptors[0].currency` | `USD` | `USD` |

### Events

One event per program per day, with 24 hourly intervals:

| Field | Pricing Example | GHG Example |
|-------|----------------|-------------|
| `eventName` | `EELEC-013532223-2026-04-12` | `MOER-PGE-2026-04-12` |
| `programID` | UUID linking to the program | UUID linking to the program |
| `intervals[n].id` | Hour of day (0 = midnight, 23 = 11 PM) | Hour of day (0 = midnight, 23 = 11 PM) |
| `intervals[n].payloads[0].type` | `PRICE` | `GHG` |
| `intervals[n].payloads[0].values[0]` | `0.02622` ($/kWh) | `661.2` (g CO2/kWh) |

### Forward window and history

**Prices**: The price server fetches a **7-day forward window** (today + 6 days) from GridX on startup and every hour. Day-ahead prices are typically available by ~4:30 PM PST. Historical prices go back to approximately August 2024 for PG&E and July 2025 for SCE.

**GHG emissions**: MOER data is fetched hourly from SGIP Signal. Today's event fills in progressively as 5-minute data becomes available. Historical data goes back approximately 30 days from initial deployment.
